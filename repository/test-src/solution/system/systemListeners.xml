<!-- 
This is the spring configuration file that is used to wire system listeners into the Pentaho
BI Platform. System listeners are notified when the platform starts up and shuts down. System 
listeners can be added, removed, and initialized here. Each bean in the list is a system listener.
You can intialize any listeners properties, as shown in the QuartzSystemListener and 
VersionCheckSystemListener.
