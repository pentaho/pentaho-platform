<!-- 
This is a Spring file that defines how Pentaho system objects are created and managed.  
An implementation of IPentahoObjectFactory, such as SpringWebPentahoObjectFactory, is 
responsible for serving objects to callers based on this file.

default-lazy-init is set to true since some of these object make calls into 
PentahoSystem which is initialized after Spring
