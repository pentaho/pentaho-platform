/**
 * Extends the PentahoBasicAclVoter class, and overrides the getEffectiveAcls method to stipulate that if the current
 * user occurrs in the access control list, that whatever access controls are listed for that user, those are the only
 * ones returned.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the user (sally) belongs to the following roles:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   <table>
 *     <tr>
 *       <th>User Id</th><th>Role</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>sally</td><td>dev</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td></td><td>mgr</td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </table>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * And the object has the following defined access controls:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   <table>
 *     <tr>
 *       <th>Role</th><th>Access</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>dev</td><td>Execute</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>sales</td><td>Execute and Subscribe</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *       <td>sally</td><td>Nothing</td>
 *     </tr>
 *   </table>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * With the standard <tt>PentahoBasicAclVoter</tt>, sally would have Execute permissions on this object because that
 * voter will simply aggregate all applicable access controls. With this voter, the returned access controls for sally
 * will be <tt>PentahoAclEntry.NOTHING</tt>.
