	This file must be configured before client tools can publish content to
the server. Publishing involves accepting a file (action sequence, XML
document, etc.) and placing it into a solution. This action should only be
allowed if the tool is configured with a server/deployment-specific password.
The RepositoryFilePublisher is now coded to expect an MD5 hash of the password
entered here before it will allow publish into the server. The BI Platform
handles the MD5 hash; the password you type into this file must be in clear
text.
	
	This is a critical security measure designed to prevent malicious
actions from being published to your server.  Please take care to make the
password sufficiently difficult to guess. Also take care that the contents of
this file are not generally available.
