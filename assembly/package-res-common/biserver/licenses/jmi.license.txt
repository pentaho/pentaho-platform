  or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
  absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.

  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
  are governed by the terms of this License, including without
  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered
  Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
  or a future version of this License released under Section
  6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every
  copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
  impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
  restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
  additional document offering the additional rights described
  in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.

  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
  must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
  this License either on the same media as an Executable version
  or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
  to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
  available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
  available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
  initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
  subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
  made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
  ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even
  if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a
  third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.

  You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to
  contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
  prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly
  or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
  (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
  version or related documentation in which You describe the
  origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

  (a) Third Party Claims.

  If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
  party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise
  the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or
  2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
  distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the
  party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
  will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
  knowledge after the Modification is made available as
  described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
  the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
  thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
  appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
  to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
  knowledge has been obtained.

  (b) Contributor APIs.

  If Contributor's Modifications include an application
  programming interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of
  patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement
  that API, Contributor must also include this information in
  the LEGAL file.

  (c) Representations.

  Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
  Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
  Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
  Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
  by this License.

3.5. Required Notices.

  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
  Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
  particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
  must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
  directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a
  notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
  add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
  Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
  documentation for the Source Code where You describe
  recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered
  Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
  or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
  only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
  requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
  Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
  this License, including a description of how and where You
  have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must
  be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
  version, related documentation or collateral in which You
  describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
  may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or
  ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
  license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
  or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
  the Executable version under a different license You must make
  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
  License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
  Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
  the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
  such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.

  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
  case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
  this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code
  due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
  extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
  they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
  file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
  distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
  able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer
  has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered
  Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.

  Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
  be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.

  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
  version of the License, You may always continue to use it
  under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
  such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
  the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the
  right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created
  under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.

  If You create or use a modified version of this License (which
  you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
  already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a)
  rename Your license so that the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public
  License," or "SPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not
  appear in your license (except to note that your license
  differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
  that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
  from the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the
  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
  described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
  modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS''
  BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
  COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
  THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
  SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
  (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
  THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
  THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

  8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
  terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
  herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming
  aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
  effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

  8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)
  against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
  Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is
  referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

  (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
  indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
  granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
  2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days
  after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to
  pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for
  Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
  Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with
  respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.
  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
  arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the
  parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
  automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
  period specified above.

  (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
  Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
  Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
  effective as of the date You first made, used, sold,
  distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
  Participant.

  8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
  Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
  Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
  claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to

  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
  COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
  COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
  BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH
  OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
  THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF

  "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer
  software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.

  only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
  License shall be governed by California law provisions (except
  to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
  excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
  disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
  entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
  States of America, any litigation relating to this License
  shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of
  the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa
  Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of
