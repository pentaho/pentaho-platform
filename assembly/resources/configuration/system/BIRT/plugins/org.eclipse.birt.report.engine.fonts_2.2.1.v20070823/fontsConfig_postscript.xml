	The default behavior:
   	1. 	PDF emitter loads the font files from the fonts folder of the plug-in 
   		"org.ecllipse.birt.report.engine.fonts". and then the system defined font
    	folder. If the section <font-paths> is set in fontsConfig.xml, the system 
    	defined font folder will be ignored, and the font files specified in section 
		<font-paths> will be loaded instead.
   
   	2. 	PDF emitter tries to use the font specified in design-time to render the pdf. 
   		If the font is a generic family, it will be mapped to a PDF embeded type1 font. 	
		"serif" to "Times-Roman" 
		"fantasy" to "Times-Roman" 
		"sans-serif" to "Helvetica"
		"monospace" to "Courier"
		"cursive" to "ZapfDingbats"
		If the font can not be built, it will go to the unicode block of that character,
		and try the font defined in that block.
		If this also fails, the character will be replaced with '?' using the default font, 
		currently "Times-Roman", to denote a place of missing character.
