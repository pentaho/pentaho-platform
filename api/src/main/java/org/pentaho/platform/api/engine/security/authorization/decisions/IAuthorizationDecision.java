 * The {@code IAuthorizationDecision} interface represents a grant or denial result of an authorization process.

 * A decision cannot represent an abstention result. To that end, an authorization rule can return an empty optional
 * result, from its {@link IAuthorizationRule#authorize(IAuthorizationRequest, IAuthorizationContext)} method.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Object#toString()} method should provide a description of the decision that is suitable for debugging,
 * auditing and logging purposes. For example:
 * <pre><code>
 * public String toString() {
 *   return String.format(
 *     "%s [granted=`%s`]",
 *     getClass().getSimpleName(),
 *     isGranted() );
