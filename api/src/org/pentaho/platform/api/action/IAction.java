/**
 * Actions are the lightweight alternative to platform components (see
 * {@link org.pentaho.platform.api.engine.IComponent}). Actions participate in action sequences and can be provided
 * inputs and resources by the typical means, as defined in xaction solution files. The {@link IAction} family of
 * interfaces focuses on describing the *minimal* contract between the Pentaho BI Platform and an Action in the same way
 * that {@link org.pentaho.platform.api.engine.IComponent} describes a similar but more involved contract.
 * <p>
 * The Pentaho BI Platform expects Action objects to be Java bean API compliant with respect to setting inputs, setting
 * resources, and getting outputs. In other words, if your action needs takes a string input, the action definition in
 * the xaction solution file will specify this string input, and the Action framework will cause that value to be set
 * via a setter method on the Action object. You do not see parameter Maps and such in the Action API for this reason.
 * All inputs, output, and resources IO will involve Java bean reflection on your Action object to find the appropriate
 * IO methods.
