/**
 * The interface for Actions that want to stream content to the caller. A "streaming" output is a special type of action
 * definition output that will result in an {@link OutputStream} being set on the Action.
 * 
 * It is generally recommended that if your Action bean yields any content for user consumption, that it implement
 * {@link IStreamingAction}. This guarantees that your Action will have the option of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>streaming the generated content back to the user, such as an HTTP servlet response
 * <li>saving the content to a content repository
 * <li>communicating with existing BI Platform components (such as EmailComponent, which expects to find attachments in
 * the content repository)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * From the perspective of the Action Sequence itself, an output is considered a "streaming" output if the attribute
 * "type" is set to "content", e.g. <code>
 * <myContentOutput type="content"/>
 * </code> The output may or may not have a globally defined destination to which it corresponds. If the output does
 * correspond to a globally defined output with a destination, then the source of the {@link OutputStream} will be
 * determined by the {@link org.pentaho.platform.api.engine.IOutputHandler} provided during the execution of the Action
 * Sequence by the {@link org.pentaho.platform.api.engine.ISolutionEngine}.
 * <p>
 * In the case that an output is considered "streaming", it will basically be treated similar to an input in that it
 * will be set on the Action with a setter method. For example, if an action definition declares a streaming output
 * called "reportContent", then the platform will attempt to call a method on the Action called
 * "setReportContentStream(OutputStream os)". Note that the post-fix "Stream" will be added to the name of your output.
 * Streaming outputs will not be queried once the Action has finished executing like a normal non-streaming output
 * would.
