/**
 * This class presents an abstraction layer for accessing resources from within a platform plugin. The idea is you do
 * not need to know how to absolutely resolve the resources you need. For example: You don't need to know the absolute
 * path if your resources are on a file-system. All you need to know in order to obtain a resource is the relative path
 * to the resource. "Relative" means relative to the base location of your plugin. For a filesystem example, let's say
 * that your plugin is installed in "/home/user/plugins/myplugin" and you need the file
 * "/home/user/plugins/myplugin/html/my.html", you would ask this class for the resource "html/my.html"
