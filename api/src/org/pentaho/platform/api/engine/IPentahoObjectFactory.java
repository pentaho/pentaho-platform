/**
 * The way the BI platform creates and manages system objects.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of how the API might be used:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * 1. IPentahoObjectFactory fac = new MyPentahoObjectFactory();<br>
 * //configure the factory with an object specification file and/or a runtime context object<br>
 * 2. fac.init(objectSpecFile, contextObject) {@link IPentahoObjectFactory#init(String, Object)}<br>
 * 3. ISolutionEngine eng = fac.get(ISolutionEngine.class, session) 
 * {@link IPentahoObjectFactory#get(Class, IPentahoSession)}
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * 
 * You will notice that the this way of serving up objects does not expose an API for scoping of objects. This behavior
 * is delegated to the particular {@link IPentahoObjectFactory} implementation, which means a factory implementation has
 * total freedom to be as simple or sophisticated at it wants without being required to handle object scoping. Any kind
 * of object binding/scoping or any other rules for the creation and management of objects is totally up the
 * implementation. Typically, a factory implementation would be made aware of it's rules for object creation by way of a
 * well-known object specification file, see {@link #init(String, Object)}
