Big data drivers are not included by default. You are required to download the drivers
individually from the support portal, if desired. The support portal is available at
https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us. After downloading a big data driver, unzip the
archive, run the installer, add the resulting .kar file to this directory and then
restart the application.

If you want the Pentaho server to read them from the default location, please copy the driver Kar files to this directory.
If you would like the Pentaho server to read the files from a different location, copy the driver Kar files to the desired location and change the value of
the SHIM_DRIVER_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION property within the kettle.properties file to the full path of the location where the Kar files were placed.
