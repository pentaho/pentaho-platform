file.title=Secure Session and Global Filters
title=global-sample
file.description=This is an example of using a global filter and a session filter.  <p/>The global filter is DEPARTMENT_LIST which provides values for the DEPARTMENT parameter.  DEPARTMENT_LIST is\tgenerated by doing an SQL 'select distinct' on the departments column.  Being a global filter, the query is executed only once and available to all users. <p/>The session filter REGION_FILTER is generated by a rule that is executed for each user that logs in.  The values are stored in the user's session and is available as long as the user remains logged in.
