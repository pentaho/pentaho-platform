## CSRF ##

# Enables CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for the server.
#
# Default value: false (unsafe, yet backward-compatible).
#
# *ATTENTION*:
# Setting this option to false opens the server and all of its plugins to known security flaws,
# which can allow an attacker to perform CSRF attacks.
#
# Do NOT set this option to false, if at all possible. Instead, consider disabling CSRF protection selectively,
# for certain platform plugins or for certain endpoints.
# This may be necessary if there still exists external code which depends on the unprotected and deprecated APIs.
#
# To disable CSRF protection for a plugin, in its `plugin.spring.xml` file, look for a bean registering
# the interface `CsrfRequestSetConfiguration`, such as of the stock class `CsrfRequestSetConfigurationPojo`
# and any accompanying documentation.
#
# To disable CSRF protection for certain server endpoints, go to the `applicationContext-spring-security-csrf.xml` file
# and, in the bean of class `CsrfRequestSetConfigurationPojo`, comment the corresponding `*-request-matcher` element.

## CORS ##

# Enable cross origin requests.
# Defaults to false.
# (commented out to give precedence to same-named legacy option in `pentaho.xml`).
#cors-requests-allowed=false

# Example: http://domainA.com, http://localhost:1337
# (commented out to give precedence to same-named legacy option in `pentaho.xml`).

# When CORS is enabled, and when set to `false` (the default), indicates that CORS is enabled
# for all requests, even those not explicitly covered by a child configuration.
#
# When set to `true`, the root CORS configuration is "abstract",
# meaning that only endpoints which are covered by an explicit and enabled child CORS
# configuration actually allow CORS. This gives more control on which endpoints actually
# support CORS at the expense of additional configuration for any endpoints not covered by
# the default configurations.
